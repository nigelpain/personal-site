        <p class="photocaption">I owe the very existence of this image to our guide on the lovely Ria Lagartos in Mexico, how he managed to spot this little fella bathing on a washed up branch from the middle of the river I will never know =)</p>
        <img src="../images/Lookout (website).jpg" alt="An image of a blackhawk perched on a dead tree branch" title="Lookout" />
        <p class="photocaption">You didn't really have to work hard to capture amazing wildlife on the Ria Lagartos, this blackhawk was just perched atop a branch on the lookout for it's next meal as we sailed past.</p>
