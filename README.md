# Read Me

This is the repo for my photography website which can be found at http://www.nigelpain.com

## Development

In order to contribute to this site you will need to do the following:

* Install the latest stable version of node_js https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* Install the latest stable version of MAMP https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/
* Clone down the contents of the repository using whichever method you prefer
* Then run `npm install gulp -g` to be able to run the gulp tasks
* Finally run `npm install` to install all of the other dependencies

Then it is just a case of starting a MAMP server running on `localhost:8888` and pointing at the app sub-folder within where you cloned down this repo, running the command `gulp` to setup the development watcher task and getting to work!
