# Read Me

This is the repo for my photography website which can be found at http://www.nigelpain.com

## Development

In order to contribute to this site you will need:

* Installed the latest stable version of node_js https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* Installed the latest stable version of MAMP https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/
* Clone down the contents of the repository using whichever method you prefer
* Then run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies

Then it is just a case of starting a MAMP server running on `localhost:8888`, running the command `gulp` to setup the development watcher task and getting to work!
